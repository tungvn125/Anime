            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Tired of endlessly scrolling for your next anime fix? Do you have more tabs open than you have friends? Let our Python-powered, AI-driven, coffee-brewing (okay, maybe not the coffee part... yet) toolkit do the heavy lifting.</p>
            <p>It's like having a personal anime butler, but without the fancy uniform and the risk of them judging your questionable life choices.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>Ready to join the elite? Of course you are. Just follow these sacred instructions. It's less painful than a filler arc, we promise.</p>
            <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Python 3.13, <a href="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli" target="_blank">ani-cli</a></p>

        </section>

        <section id="usage">
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>Using this is easier than understanding the plot of <em>Evangelion</em>. Just tell the script what you want.</p>
            <p>To see all the available commands, run:</p>
            <pre><code>python main.py --help</code></pre>
            <p>Or run without arguments to open the interactive Terminal UI (TUI):</p>
            <pre><code>python main.py</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="tui">
            <h2>Interactive TUI</h2>
            <p>Run the program without arguments to open an interactive terminal UI inspired by gemini-cli. The TUI exposes shortcuts for Chat, Search, Recommend, Watch, Read LN, Genre Manager, Watchlist, and the new Manga Manager.</p>
            <p>It uses <code>simple-term-menu</code> to provide a keyboard-friendly selection interface and submenus for related actions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="manga-manager">
            <h2>Manga Manager</h2>
            <p>The Manga Manager is a new feature available via the TUI and the AI chat assistant. It lets you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for manga (interactive results with quick actions like view on MAL or add to readlist).</li>
                <li>Get simple keyword-based manga recommendations.</li>
                <li>Maintain a persistent readlist saved to <code>readlist.json</code> (add and list items).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="chat-calls">
            <h2>Chat Function Calls</h2>
            <p>The AI chat assistant can call functions to perform actions like adding anime to your watchlist, opening an anime to watch, or managing manga readlist items. When the assistant requests a function call, the CLI executes it and returns the function result to the model; the assistant's follow-up message is shown immediately.</p>
